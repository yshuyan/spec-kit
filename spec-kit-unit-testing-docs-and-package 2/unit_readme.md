## ðŸ¤” What is Spec-Driven Unit Testing?

Spec-Driven Unit Testing applies the same structured, intent-driven principles of Spec-Driven Development to the process of creating unit tests. Instead of writing test code directly, you start by creating a high-level specification of what needs to be tested. This specification is then used to generate a detailed test plan, actionable tasks, and finally, the complete test suite.

This approach ensures that your tests are comprehensive, well-documented, and directly aligned with your feature's requirements.

## âš¡ Get started

Before you begin, install the Specify CLI directly from the provided wheel package.

### 1. Install Specify CLI from the wheel

Locate the packaged wheel file (for example, `specify_cli_yshuyan-1.0-py3-none-any.whl`) and install it with `pip`:

```bash
pip install specify_cli_yshuyan-1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

> Replace the path if you stored the wheel elsewhere.

### 2. Specify the tests

Use the `/specify-unit` command to describe the component or behavior you want to test. Focus on the **what** and **why**, not the implementation details of the tests.

```bash
/specify-unit test user authentication with edge cases and security validation
```

This will create a new test branch and a `test-spec.md` file under the `tests/` directory.

### 3. Create a technical test plan

Use the `/plan-unit` command to generate a detailed technical plan for your tests. This includes selecting testing frameworks, designing mocks, and defining test data.

```bash
/plan-unit
```

### 4. Break down into tasks

Use `/tasks-unit` to create an actionable list of tasks from your test plan.

```bash
/tasks-unit
```

### 5. Execute test implementation

Use `/implement-unit` to execute all the testing tasks and build your test suite.

```bash
/implement-unit
```

## ðŸ¤– Supported AI Agents

All AI agents supported by the main Spec Kit workflow are also supported for the unit testing workflow, including:

- Claude Code
- GitHub Copilot
- Gemini CLI
- Cursor
- Qwen Code
- opencode
- Windsurf
- And more...

## ðŸ”§ CLI Reference

The unit testing workflow introduces a new set of slash commands that mirror the main development commands.

| Command           | Description                                                           |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/specify-unit`   | Define what you want to test (requirements and scenarios)             |
| `/plan-unit`      | Create a technical test implementation plan with your chosen frameworks |
| `/tasks-unit`     | Generate actionable task lists for test implementation                |
| `/implement-unit` | Execute all tasks to build the test suite according to the plan       |

## ðŸ“š Core philosophy

- **Intent-driven testing**: Define the *what* and *why* of your tests before the *how*.
- **Structured process**: Follow a multi-step refinement process for creating robust tests.
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works with popular testing frameworks like `pytest`, `Jest`, `JUnit`, `XCTest`, and more.
- **Comprehensive planning**: Goes beyond just writing test cases to include test strategy, data management, and mocking.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### Comprehensive Test Planning
- **Test Strategy Design**: Framework selection, mocking approach, data management.
- **Quality Standards**: Coverage targets, performance requirements, CI integration.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential testing challenges and mitigation strategies.

### Technical Excellence  
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works with pytest, Jest, JUnit, XCTest, and others.
- **Mock Management**: Systematic approach to creating and managing test doubles.
- **Test Data**: Structured approach to test data generation and management.

### Quality Assurance
- **Coverage Requirements**: Automated coverage tracking and validation.
- **Performance Testing**: Built-in performance test scenarios.
- **Flaky Test Detection**: Tools to identify and eliminate non-deterministic tests.
